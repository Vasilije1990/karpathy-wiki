## Excerpt

nanochat is the simplest experimental harness for training LLMs. It is designed to run on a single GPU node, the code is minimal/hackable, and it covers all major LLM stages including tokenization, pretraining, finetuning, evaluation, inference, and a chat UI. For example, you can train your own GPT-2 capability LLM (which cost ~$43,000 to train in 2019) for only $48 (~2 hours of 8XH100 GPU node) and then talk to it in a familiar ChatGPT-like web UI. On a spot instance, the total cost can be closer to ~$15. More generally, nanochat is configured out of the box to train an entire miniseries of compute-optimal models by setting one single complexity dial: `--depth`, the number of layers in the GPT transformer model (GPT-2 capability happens to be approximately depth 26). All other hyperparameters (the width of the transformer, number of heads, learning rate adjustments, training horizons, weight decays, ...) are calculated automatically in an optimal way.

For questions about the repo, I recommend either using [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/karpathy/nanochat) from Devin/Cognition to ask questions about the repo, or use the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions), or come by the [#nanochat](https://discord.com/channels/1020383067459821711/1427295580895314031) channel on Discord.

Presently, the main focus of development is on tuning the pretraining stage, which takes the most amount of compute. Inspired by the modded-nanogpt repo and to incentivise progress and community collaboration, nanochat maintains a leaderboard for a "GPT-2 speedrun", which is the wall-clock time required to train a nanochat model to GPT-2 grade capability, as measured by the DCLM CORE score. The [runs/speedrun.sh](runs/speedrun.sh) script always reflects the reference way to train GPT-2 grade model and talk to it. The current leaderboard looks as follows:
